# HTTP Honeypot
A simple web honeypot designed to capture typical hacking web requests and respond with mock answers. This project creates a fake web server that deliberately replies very, very sloooooowwwwwly, effectively locking up malicious web clients for extended periods‚Äîhours or even days. The idea is to place your real web server on a different port, letting this honeypot keep script kiddies busy while leaving your actual server undisturbed.

## Features
- üåê Provides a tarpit for would-be attackers.
- üõ°Ô∏è Protects your real web server by acting as a decoy.
- üïí Responds intentionally slowly to keep attackers locked in.
